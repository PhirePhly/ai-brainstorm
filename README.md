# Making an AI brainstorm

This is a ridiculous python script for playing with Ollama tool calling and demonstrate how silly unsupervised AI brainstorming can get.

Given the original materials.yaml file with about 12 economic materials you might find in a space RPG video game, this script will ask the AI to look at it and add a few more.

The `materials.yaml.gpt-oss-20b` file is after leaving gpt-oss:20b running in a while true loop for 12 hours on a small 40W CPU.
